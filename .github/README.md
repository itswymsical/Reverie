PROJECT: REVERIE
--------------------------------
*This is the GitHub repository for the Terraria Reverie Mod.*
A worldbuilding-focused mod built around open **exploration** and ambient **storytelling**. Traverse Terraria and *otherworlds*; let curiosity lead to discovery!
**Otherworlds** feature distinct cultures and tones, each offering their own unique experiences & history. (Archaea's Cactus County, Cybercity, etc.)
Side missions provide glimpses into larger mysteries... you can piece together the connections or let them remain unknown.

Reverie focuses on exploration and interaction over an RPG-like progression, creating space to explore, discover, and truly be immersed in the sandbox.
