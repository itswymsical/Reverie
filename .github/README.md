PROJECT: REVERIE
--------------------------------
*This is the GitHub repository for the Terraria Reverie Mod.*

A worldbuilding-focused mod built around open exploration and ambient storytelling. Traverse Terraria and otherworlds; let curiosity lead to discovery!

Otherworlds feature distinct cultures and tones, each offering their own unique experiences & history. 
Sideline missions provide glimpses into larger mysteries... you can piece together the connections or let them remain unknown.

Reverie focuses on exploration and interaction over an RPG-like progression, creating space to explore, discover, and truly be immersed in the sandbox.
