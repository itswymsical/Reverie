		WakingUp: {
			Line1: What the..?
			Line2: You're awake?!?
			Line3: Long nap, 'eh?
			Line4: I honestly thought you'd never wake up.
			Line5: Anyways...
			Line6: While you were in your coma, the assailants left our society in shambles.
			Line7: "'You give a blank stare'"
			Line8: ...
			Line9: Amnesia too? golly.
			Line10: Well, now isn't the time for explanation.
			Line11: Come take these copper tools and i'll give it to you straight.
		}

		Briefing: {
			Line1: Like I said, I'll be quick about it:
			Line2: Terraria, once a highly populated world is now desolate. The credit goes to Cthulhu and the assailants.
			Line3: He was once an ally of Terraria, him and the world of Seaforth.
			Line4: But now he's our adversary.
			Line5: A little over two years ago, Terraria was in alliance with some Otherworlds.
			Line6: Those being Sylvanwalde and Seaforth. But because of some...
			Line7: ...rather disgraceful events...
			Line8: We are here today in what you can barely call an Otherworld.
			Line9: During the war's final battle, you were knocked out by the Eye.
			Line10: The Archivers and Dryads fought back against the Assailants, but the death toll was high.
			Line11: Sorry to lay this on you, but you'll need to start training.
			Line12: Oh, I forgot to tell you you're the HERO by the way. My bad.
			Line13: Three years have passed since the war, and Cthulhu's seal will break in just 8 months.
			Line14: Given your memory loss, we don't have much time to spare.
			Line15: Pick any of these four combat types, make sure you want this to be your signature style.
		}

		TrainingComplete: {
			Line1: Decent work.
			Line2: Although, this is just a target dummy. You'll need some better weapons if you wanna fight for real.
			Line3: But before you run off, I have some gear for you.
		}

		GuideGivesYouAMagicMirror: {
			Line1: Take this Magic Mirror, it'll allow you to magically return to this location.
			Line2: You can also use it to check the MirrorNet.
			Line3: Gaze into the mirror and you'll be able to REFLECT on yourself.
			Line4: (Right-Click or use the UI element to check your stats and progress)
			Line5: You'll need to explore the outskirts of the forest to find new materials.
			Line6: I'd recommend going underground into the caverns, where you can find new gear and minerals.
			Line7: But be careful--the things down there are nothing like that target dummy.
			Line8: Once you've collected a decent amount of resources, come back here and check in.
		}

		ReawakeningEndingDialogue: {
			Line1: I'm impressed by your speed.
			Line2: Say... do you think you're ready to take on the weakest assailant?
			Line3: No pressure, no pressure.
			Line4: If you can't do it you don't have to fake it.
			Line5: I'm just teasing you, I know you're ready!
			Line6: You're going to be fighting the very thing that knocked you out the first time:
			Line7: The Eye of Cthulhu...
			Line8: I sent the task list to your MirrorNet contact, just do those things and come back to me before dusk.

		SelectedClass: {
			Marksman: {
				Line1: Marksman? My kind of guy.

				Line3: Hit the target dummy 10 times.

				Line3: Hit the target dummy 10 times.
			}

			Conjurer: {
				Line1: Conjurer? Not much of a fighter, huh?
				Line2: Alright, let's start off with commanding an attack.
				Line3: Tell your minion to hit the target dummy 10 times.
			}

		GuideWhenYouFindAnAccessory: {
			Line1: Hey There!
			Line2: I'm calling you from the MirrorNet.
			Line3: I noticed you found an accessory.
			Line4: Those are quite handy. In fact, they'll be integral to your arsenal.
			Line5: If you're not a complete noob, you probably know you can equip that one you just picked up with [Right-Click].
			Line6: Anyways, I'm just doing guide stuff.
			Line7: I'll leave you to it.
		}

		EnteredWoodlandCanopyBeforeProgression: {
			Line1: Hey! I'm looking at your location on the MirrorNet.
			Line2: Looks like you're in the Woodland Canopy?
			Line3: I'm all for you exploring, but you should know that place is pretty dangerous in your current state.
			Line4: Why don't you explore some other biomes?
			Line5: I'll give you the signal when you're ready to enter the canopy.
		}

		KilledTheEye: {
			Line1: You split that eye faster than the witch doctor ravages open their amazon packages!
			Line2: Remind me not to get on your bad side...
			Line3: With that out of the way, we can focus on the challenges that lie ahead.
			Line4: I reached out to a certain friend of mine from Sylvanwalde.
			Line5: She's cold, yet charming. I think you'll like her...
			Line6: Not only that, her expertise in cleansing magic will be necessary for cleaning the 'vulgar' biomes.
			Line7: By that I mean the Crimson and Corruption.
			Line8: If you didn't know, they're made from dead people.

		ArgiesHuntIntro: {

			Line1: OH!
			Line2: Hey! Who are you?
			Line3: Hmmmm....
			Line4: You don't look like a treant...
			Line5: Are you????
			Line6: A HUMAN??????
			Line7: *scrambling*
			Line8: *scrambling*
			Line9: Wait a second... You don't entirely give off human vibes...
			Line10: What exactly are you?
			Line11: Hero, you say?
			Line12: OH, well...
			Line13: That's relieving...
			Line14: What the heck is a Hero???
			Line15: Ah, nevermind that.
			Line16: Say, could you help me out?
			Line17: My friend [UNK], is out exploring right now and I need some help with blacksmithing.
			Line18: As you can see, I don't have arms.
			Line19: Do you think you can gather some ores for me?
