	CrashLanding_2: {
		Suspicions: {
			Line1: I can't help but wonder if your arrival and these disturbances are connected somehow.
			Line2: There's an ancient power spoken of in legends, known as Reverie.

		}

		}

		UnnaturalPhenomena: {
			Line1: Something's not right with that creature. It's like it's been corrupted by a strange energy.
			Line2: Be careful. It seems to be particularly aggressive towards you.
		}

		AfterBattle: {
			Line1: I couldn't help but notice how the creature seemed drawn to you, hero.
			Line2: It's as if your presence intensified its aggression.
			Line3: There might be more to your abilities than meets the eye.
			Line4: I wonder if your arrival and these disturbances are somehow connected to Reverie.

		}

			Line1: We need to be ready to face whatever comes our way.
			Line2: You should get stronger and master your abilities.
			Line3: The fate of the world may very well rest on your shoulders.
		}

		ThePathToRevelation: {
			Line1: If we want to figure out why you ended up here, we should keep finding these ancient textbooks.
			Line2: There are temples, ruins, and wise sages scattered throughout the land.
			Line3: They may hold the key to unlocking the secrets of Reverie and why your here.

	ArchiverChronicles.Book1: I, Laine L., record these words as testimony to what I have witnessed. The veil between worlds grows thin, and I can no longer distinguish between vision and reality. They call it Reverie—this force of unity that flows through all things like currents in an endless sea. I've felt it pulse beneath my fingertips when touching ancient stone. It is creation itself, the binding thread that connects all consciousness. But where light casts, shadow follows. The oppositional force—Apathia—grows stronger. It is not merely absence or void, but active resistance; A severing, A willful rejection of connection. I've seen them—the Assailants—moving through our world like oil through water, never truly mixing with what surrounds them. They are harbingers of something vast and hungry that waits beyond our perception. Their master dwells in the sunken depths where pressure should crush any living thing. Yet he endures, a being of immense will who once sought to unite the disparate world of a distant ocean kingdom. He now seeks not to elevate but to dissolve—to return all consciousness to the primordial soup from which it emerged. I am not the hero destined to face him. I merely record what approaches. The hero will come from beyond, trailing light like a falling star.
