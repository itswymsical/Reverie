			Line1: Oh! Oh! Have you seen any Bloomcap Buttons?
			Line2: They're these soft, squeaky little mushroom caps that grow near Living Trees.
			Line3: I’m redecorating my stump, and I *need* something adorable!
			Line4: Could you bring me some? Just a handful will do!
			Line5: (Whispering) They giggle if you tickle them... but don’t tell them I said that.
