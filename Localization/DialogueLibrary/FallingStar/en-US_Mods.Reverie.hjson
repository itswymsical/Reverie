	AFallingStar: {
		Cutscene.Line1: Hey! Do you guys hear that?
		Intro.Line1: WHAT THE HELL?!?!

		CrashLanding: {
			Line1: That's one way to make an entrance...
			Line2: This place just keeps getting weirder and weirder...
			Line3: How are you still alive?
			Line4: Y'know what, I don't even wanna ask.
			Line5: How's about you come meet the townsfolk?
		}

		GatheringResources: {
			Line1: where did you fall from exactly?
			Line2: That was a pretty gnarly landing, I'll assume your no normal Terrarian judging how you survived that fall.
			Line3: It's odd though. you look like us, yet you give off an otherworldy presence...
			Line4: Around here, everyone works for their portions. If you want to survive, you'll have to gather resources.
			Line5: Explore around the area a bit, there's a lot to see in this world of ours.
			Line6: Before you go, I have this for ya. It's a little something to help you get started. If you're looking for tools, ask the Merchant.
		}

		ExploreBiomes: {
			Line1: Done chatting already? Cool, you should go explore the world a bit.
			Line2: Open your inventory, you'll see a task list near your armor slots.
			Line3: That's the MirrorNet log, it tracks your progress and gives you hints on what to do next.
			Line4: As a starter, I suggest you gather some resources and explore the biomes around here.
			Line5: Well then, see ya later! Let me know if you find anything interesting.
		}

		ChimeResponse: {
			Line1: What was that sound?
			Line2: Did anyone else hear that?
		}

		ArchiverChronicleIFound: {
			Line1: Whoa. I'm seeing some kind of mirror signal...
			Line2: It's reflecting strange runes onto the MirrorNet.
			Line3: Mind if I take a look at it? I'll try deciphering it while you explore.
		}

		GuideReadsChronicleI: {
			Line1: Fascinating... even bad handwriting transcends time.
			Line2: I'll see what I can do with this while you're out.
			Line3: I think I can make out some of the inscriptions, but it's a bit jumbled.
		}

		ChronicleDecoded: {
			Line1: Hey, I think I figured out what the runes mean.
			Line2: It looks like the person who wrote this was named 'Laine L.', apparently they used to be part of a historian group called "Archivers".
			Line3: They were trying to find a way to travel between dimensions, and stop some force of evil.
			Line4: The Chronicle doesn't say specifically what that evil is, but it seems like they were trying to stop it from destroying the world.
			Line5: Also, it mentions of soliders residing here in Terraria, and a place called the Stillspire Outpost.
			Line6: I've never heard of that place before, but it sounds like it would belong to the Corruption. I'd stay far away from there if I were you.
			Line7: Then again, your not exactly the average Terrarian, are you? Maybe you could handle it.
		}

		WildlifeWoes: {
			Line1: Hey, we've got a lot of slimes prancing about.
			Line2: Nothing to worry about! they're pretty feeble.
			Line3: Clear them out, we'll be able to explore the area more safely.
		}

		SlimeInfestation: {
			Line1: There's definitely something going on with these slimes.
			Line2: I've never seen this aggressive before... something must be agitating the ecosystem.
		}

		SlimeInfestation_Commentary: {
			Line1: Hey, i'm kind of in some trouble here with the slimes, hehe...
			Line2: I could really use your help!
		}

		SlimeRain: {
			Line1: You've gotta be kidding me...
			Line2: I've never seen anything like it... the slimes are raining from the sky!
		}

		SlimeRain_Commentary: {
			Line1: Slimes falling from the sky? What's next, flying pigs?
			// Reminder: Add a callback in the future to this line when a pigron is discovered.
			
			Line2: I thought I'd seen it all, but this takes the cake!
		}

		SlimeRain_Warning: {
			Line1: This is getting kind of out of hand...
			Line2: Maybe you should build an arena to fight them off?
		}

		KS_Encounter: {
			Line1: That's one big ass slime... Must be there king, or something.
			Line2: I think you pissed it off by killing so many of it's servants.
			Line3: Heh, didn't know that would cause this to happen. My bad.
		}

		KingSlimeDefeat: {
			Line1: That was too much to handle...
			Line2: I don't have a good feeling about the nature of the creature aggression.
			Line3: They've been like this since you arrived...
			Line4: and you do have that glowy aura...
		}
